* Here are some instructions on how to run the production version of MCLIMIT

The current version of tool which uses MCLIMIT to extract Bayesian and
CLs limits is optimized for the Winter inputs, the initial files we
had still need to be converted to remove the unnecessary histogram
duplicates. This could be done with old/convert.C, just use run.zsh.

Two converted background and signal files are available here
- old/convert/bkg_lljj_g1jet_mll110_mlljj400_M_ALL_35_SS_rebin_10.root
- old/convert/sig_WR_wr800_nr300_eemm_ss_sys.root

The shared MCLIMIT library could be found in the current directory:
libMCL.so
and is produced by running lib.C macro which takes the compliled 
MCLIMIT object file from the directory above and produces the library.
The MCLIMIT code from the directory above has fixes for being built on
SLC5, it does not fully correspond to the production version,
the fixes were taken from the development version, all details could
be found in the official MCLIMIT page.

To run the limits one could simply try to execute:

./run_local.zsh (run locally)
or
./run_t3.zsh (run on T3)

which invokes the tool called "toy", please use the Makefile to build
it, and please adjust the path to libMCL.so in it, if needed.
Also, please source setup.sh before running the toy, this adds
the libMCL.so location to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

This was tested with the several versions of ROOT and gcc, no
significant differences have been observed between either 5.26,
5.28, 5.30, but the recommendation is to use the latest 5.30 version.

CLs limits extraction takes pretty much of time, so be patient,
please set a large number of pseudo-experiments being generated
for getting reasonable results.

Any questions/suggestions are welcome.
